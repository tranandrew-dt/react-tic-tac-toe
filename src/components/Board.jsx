//app just renders board
//board needs state of all 9 squares, whether x or o
//state of player turn (or whether x or o is next
//maybe a map to render all three rows instead of hardcoding lmao
//how is a winner determined? Is there a way to search the combinations of the squares??
// hope i don't have to hard-code win conditions...
// I mean i guess it's just all hori, verti, and the two diags (3+3+2)
// If i know who is next, can't i show an onHover of their icon on empty squares?
//...shit also look fugly atm
